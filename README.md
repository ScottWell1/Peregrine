Peregrine Laser Power Meter (LPM) Utility

Initial release of Peregrine LPM 1.6.0, a utility to collect and graph data from various Laser Power Meters.  With Peregrine,
you can connect to a variety of Laser Power Meters via RS232 or USB, collect and analyze data with graphs and exported CSV files.

Peregrine is written in the Processing IDE, which produces a Java application.  See the "Releases" page for installation tips.

History: Peregrine was originally written as closed source by Trevor White. His last updates were in Oct-2013. Between 2013 and 2021, updates to Java
rendered the existing code inoperable, and updates to Processing made it impossible to recompile. Mr. White released Peregrine as Open Source, under GNU 
License, in Nov-2017.  This project picks up from there, with an initial release of version 1.6.0 in August 2021.
