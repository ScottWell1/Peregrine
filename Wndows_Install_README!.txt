Peregrine is written in Processing 4.0, which produces a Java application.

Java applications need the Java Runtime Library in order to execute.  This library can
be embedded by Processing, BUT....  It makes the code too large to publish on Github.

If you don't already have the Java libraries installed, you'll get an error.  That can be
fixed by installing the Java "OpenJDK" binaries from the Eclipse Foundation web site here:
